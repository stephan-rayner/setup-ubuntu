# Setup Ubuntu

This is my one stop shop for setting up an ubuntu box the way I like it.

# Usage

If you don't have `make` installed or don't know run `bash init.sh` script.

Once `make` is installed run the appropriate make command. If you don't know and you are not setting up a respberry pi run `make all`.

NOTE: If you are setting up a raspberry pi run `make jeeves`.
